When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### This portfolio piece is a power analysis I did for my thesis. I used the package from the following link and there was also a tutorial on how to use the package:
#https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Superpower/vignettes/intro_to_superpower.html#anova_design-function

```{r load-libraries}
library(Superpower)
```


# I calculated my means and SDs in excel and used the highest SD of my conditions.
```{r }
old_design <- ANOVA_design(design = "2w*2w",
                             n=10,
                             mu = c(1232.0,1293.31,1159.46,1410.40),
                             sd = 298,
                             r <- c(0.821,0.784,0.603,0.866,0.744,0.877),
                             labelnames = c("CueType","Shift","Hold","BlockType","MostlyHold","MostlyShift")
                             )
```

#plot power using sample size defined in old design
```{r}
plot_power(old_design, min_n=5, max_n = 100, desired_power=80, exact2 = TRUE)
```


#Run a power simulation based on the N defined above.
```{r}
results=ANOVA_power(design_result = old_design,alpha_level = 0.05, nsims = 10000, seed=1234,)
```
